_they meet — floating — in the station’s keep,_  
_where there is no gravity._

**PG**  
In school  
my research was focused on Tortuga.  
You know, the floating city  
down on Earth.  
they meet — floating — in the station’s keep,  
where there is no gravity.  

**CC**  
The last green place on earth.  
The last grasses, the last trees.  

**PG**  
And I’d already been learning to program  
by studying the rhythms and cycles of our orbital plants and pollinators,  
all the last organic systems  
left more or less unchanged since the way they were on ancient earth.  
So when I learned that these rare plants were still thriving down there,  
in such clean and beautiful parks,  
I thought, you know, how bad could that be?  
But then,  
I listened to histories from refugees  
during my time at L3  
and they told me about “JUSTICE” — the Autonomous Construct, not the concept,  
the rings implanted in their inner-ears at birth  
whispering its commands,  
controlling their sense of balance,  
bringing them to their knees if they hesitated to obey.  

**CC**  
It’s true, it creates a Network out of the people living there,  
using their bodies as a System of Things to keep the city afloat,  
and the parks maintained.  

**AS**  
How did those refugees escape their conditioning?  

**PG**  
They said they disobeyed “JUSTICE”  
just once  
and it cast them overboard.  
They hijacked some kind of metal fish — a morality bot —  
and used it as a raft, and signaled up for help  
in hopes that someone here was watching.  
The refugees brought rumors with them, too  
of a corroded, inverted under-city, Tortuga’s Underbelly  
where outcasts still cling to the island that’s abandoned them,  
where new humans are born, free from this implanted “JUSTICE”  
but born drowned, in the dark, humans who will live and die and never see the stars,  
people, souls, who might prefer to live up here with us  
but don’t even know that we exist.  
It sort of soured me, I have to say, on the whole idea of blue culture.  

**AS**  
What?  
But Tortuga is the last green place on earth.  

**PG**  
But doesn’t “JUSTICE”  
feel a bit familiar?  
Doesn’t it work a little too much  
like the blue constructs you both always use?  
Always offering suggestions of a “next best thing” that you should do?  
I know for you it’s still a choice.  
I really don’t mean to offend.  
I know life on this blue station is more humane in many ways than life on earth.  
But doesn’t the guilt of not complying with every single small suggestion  
feel a little bit like being thrown into the sea?

**CC**  
That’s not what it feels like.  
The way the blue constructs structure your day  
feels like something easy to rest on,  
so your mind can wander farther out,  
knowing that the immediate is taken care of  
in the best possible way.

**AS**  
Yeah, I don’t think it’s fair to compare my culture to any place on earth.

### THE BLUE ASTRONAUT’S PROPOSITION:

_We’re entering a brief period of alignment, when this blue telescope could focus its lens_  
_on the area of earth where Tortuga is projected to be floating._

_If bluecorp culture is in danger of decline in the direction of Tortuga’s “JUSTICE,” then_  
_there must be a similarity between Tortuga and this blue station._  
_We’ll focus the station’s observatories on Tortuga, and see it for ourselves._

_And if there are outcasts to be rescued,_  
_maybe we can help._

_And maybe we can find some evidence_  
_of the existence of this Underbelly,._  
_And maybe we an offer an invitation to any people who might be living there._

## .ACT ONE.
***the search for tortuga***

**GOAL: TRIANGULATE**

PUBLISH GAIA (GREEN) DATA ON ALL 3 OBSERVATORIES  
TO LOCATE & REVEAL THE EARTH CARD: TORTUGA  

**SOLVE BEFORE THE END OF THE FIFTH TURN  
WHEN THE STATION PASSES OUT OF ALIGNMENT**


_when TORTUGA is revealed,  
all return to the keep._
