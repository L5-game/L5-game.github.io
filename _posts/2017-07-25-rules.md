# L5
*Version 0.6.2*

## In the box

* 1-5 Character IDs and matching plastic Character Tokens
* 2-10 Tech and Accessory placemats 
* (1x of each/character)
* 5-25 New Media cards 
* (1x of each color/number combination)
* 3-16 Reference cards 
* (5x Global Powers, 5x Technologies, 3x Ecosystems, 1x Internet)
* 3-5 Arcades and 1 Keep
* 10-50 Data (dice) 
* (10x of each color)

## Setting up

1. Separate the New Media cards by Suit (Number/Action Color/Room Icon). Shuffle each Suit and place them as face-down decks around the playing area.
2. Choose 3 references - one of each type: an ecosystem, a technology, and a global power, and place them face up at the top of the playing space.
    a. OPTIONAL: Place additional references (perhaps equal to the number of players) into the New Media decks.
3. Freely arrange the arcades (recommend using # of players + 1) in relation to the keep to create the Station.
4. Each player creates or selects one or more characters:
    a. Choose a Character ID - defining their career and culture.
    b. Place a corresponding character token in the keep.
    c. Find the tech and accessory matching your character’s career and place them beside your ID
    d. If your character does not yet have a lucky number you must choose one for them.
    e. Receive a data (die) matching your character’s culture. Roll it and choose to keep that number (or star) or change it to your character’s lucky number. Place it number-up on the orange diamond on your tech.
5. Deal out one New Media cards on top of each of the three references - covering the artwork and type, but keeping the name visible. 
    a. The team may choose any cards from the top of any deck(s), but must place them across the references from left to right.

TAKING TURNS
Recieve or Roll Data. Players must either:
Receive a data matching the culture of the station they’re currently on, roll it, and place it on their tech, or
Roll all the data on either their tech or accessory and return them to that device (optionally rearranging them within that device). Note that if a player does not have room to receive a data then they must roll.

Play. Players may in any order - meaning, that any individual turns can happen in any order, and all the turns can happen in any sequence, and freely overlapping. Each player gets to do the things listed below once per turn, and when everyone has done all they can, the turn is over. 

YOU MAY:
Use the power of either your tech or your accessory.
Use your character’s A-Move, B-Move, -or- Z-Move (as detailed on the Character ID)
Use the Action on any number of New Media cards.
Illuminate References. 

Add to the Stacks. At the end of the turn, the host deals one New Media card from the deck onto each pile burying a Reference.

CAVEATS about Adding to the Stacks:
If a stack already has 5 New Media cards, then the sixth is played into the stream noun-side up. The host then places a crisis matching the number of that card in a the room of the Action it covers. 

If no New Media cards have been played or if all instances of that room already have a crisis, the  host chooses anywhere on the station to put it.

If an Reference is drawn, then it starts a new stack, and another card from the deck is played on it immediately before returning to play another card on the original Reference. (If another Reference is drawn, start a new stack with it too and continue to draw New Media cards, placing them on the most recently drawn References first until all References are covered

USING MOVES
A-move
You can move the number of spaces it says on your ID. Moving a space means moving your token from its current room to an adjacent room, from/to any travel pattern indicated on your ID card. Clerics are special because they can move from anywhere to a server but it costs 3 data.
B-move
This lets you rearrange cards in the stacks in a specific way.
Z-move
This lets you rearrange data on your tech and accessory. You can move data between your tech and accessory and put them in any display spot. You can’t, however change the number or reroll.
Clearing & Illuminating
Clearing New Media cards.

To clear New Media card from the piles burying the References, you must have the data matching the card and be in the room shown in the upper right corner of the card. Clear New Media cards by placing a data (die) in the discard pile - a data (die) matching exactly the culture (color) and number displayed in the lower left corner of the card. Collect the card itself and lay it by your character card where you can play it as an Action at any time. 

You must clear the cards in order from top to bottom, but you may simultaneously clear the data below it (in sequence) by discarding the appropriate data (dice).
Illuminating References.
To illuminate a Reference, the card must be totally clear of New Media.

You can use the data displayed in the Orange Diamond on your tech, and your character token must be in the Orange Square on your ID card, no matter its culture or number.

You can also use an Orange Action (found on New Media Cards in the Observatory suit) from any room, using data of the culture referenced, no matter its number. 

PLAYING ACTIONS
You can play any number of the Actions written on the cleared New Media cards you have in front of you during your turn. And you don’t have to be anywhere special to play them. To perform an Action, place it face up in the stream and do what it says on the card.
RESOLVING CRISES
When a crisis happens, a data (die) matching the number and culture (color) of the card that created the crisis is placed in a room. That room can no longer be used to illuminate References or illuminate New Media cards by means of your ID. (You can still perform Actions there).

To resolve a crisis, you can use a number-matching New Media card (from anywhere), or go to the location of the crisis and discard a data matching its number.
Winning
To win, illuminate one of each of the kinds of References (a technology, an environment, and a global power). Note that The Internet is wild (it can count as any of the above).
Losing
You lose if the station fills up with crises.
Or the deck runs out.
