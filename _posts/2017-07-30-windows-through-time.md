Life in the Orbit is cradled within swirling **Stations** &mdash; communities of culturally diverse **Arcades** rotating around a central **Keep**, and in relation to a sail-like **Shade** that protects the inhabitants from cosmic radiation, creates an orienting middle-distance horizon line, and serves as a common surface on which to project New Media where it’s accessible to everyone aboard the station.
 
**Arcades** are divided into five types of public space &mdash; **Rooms** defined by their specific use and marked by their distinctive windows. All of these giant windows into the void provide views of the Earth, the Moon, the Shade, the stars, and the rest of station itself, giving the station’s residents a chance to breathe deeply and orient themselves in orbit.

The earliest **Observatory** was the cupola module of the International Space Station – an ancient structure in low Earth orbit and the first model for commercial space habitation. Ancient **Astronauts** gathered around the cupola for communal meals and important meetings, that then-unique view of the Earth keeping their discourse in perspective. Now, Observatories serve as a center of bureaucratic life, where Astronauts schedule future configurations of the station using an intricate, clock-like kinetic model that hangs in the center of the **View**&mdash; the enormous circular window that still looks out on humanity’s first home.

**Amphitheaters** were first designed as destinations for early space tourists eager for an unforgettable experience in the Orbit, and they remain the center of cultural life to this day. Their impressive **Panoramas** wrap around the entire Arcade with only the thinnest necessary structure interrupting the illusion of floating freely in space. The panorama plays a central role in many shows, framing dazzling displays of drone acrobatics, pantomime flotillas, and zero-G sets, and serving as a beautiful, sweeping backdrop for the **Divas** that perform there.

Though an early, necessary technology in space, **Vents**, the narrow air-locked windows found in a station’s **Garages**, proliferated in the period after the Orbital Society was forced to ban the Earth-infected Internet throughout L5. In the absence of a wireless network to connect the arcades, **Programmers** conduct the flow of information with flocks of drones carrying data and new media throughout the station, simultaneously keeping the atmosphere and internal weather of the station in constant circulation.

**Servers** are the only locations where the ban on computer networking is relaxed, and these quiet, spa-like data lounges host powerful strains of the local culture’s **AI. Clerics** spend their days plugged into the Server’s local Cloud, where they can communicate with their AI and with each other at nearly the speed of thought. The Server’s window is a large, paneled **Screen**, where publicly displayed issues, findings, and announcements help facilitate large collaborative projects happening in the room, or anywhere on the station with a sightline to the screen.

**Studios** are set up in new sections of arcade as they are still being built, and filled with the people most invested in the new Rooms under construction. The raw space often fills with festival-like pop-up villages where **Producers** create and share their art as they work together to design the new habitation. The **Vista** is the transparent barrier that separates the new construction from the vacuum of space and acts as scaffolding for the drones and printers fabricating the new exteriors of the rooms-to-be.
