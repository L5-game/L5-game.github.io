Orbital life is organized around five kinds of public space that each feature a different variety of window. Without windows, space would be a nightmare of disorientation and claustrophobia, but big open public spaces combined with windows that offer views of the Earth, the Moon, the stars, and the station itself give a station’s residents a chance to breathe deeply and orient themselves in orbit.

# Observatory

Stations as far back as the International Space Station have had a deticated observatory. When commercial space habitation began, **Astronauts** required every station have an observatory to make living and working on the station possible. 

The **view** is designed to facilitate Astronauts’ work scheduling the often intricate clock-like movement of the station’s semicircular habitation structures, or arcades.  In the center hangs an intricate kinetic model of the station that’s used to plan future configurations. 

# Ampitheater

Amphitheaters were first designed for the entertainment of paying space tourists. Now, orbital popular culture revolves around media that’s created **Divas** who kockey to perform on the biggest stages

The **panorama** is not only a beautiful sweeping backdrop, but also plays a central role in many shows, with dazzling displays of drone acrobatics and perfectly timed set changes courtesy of the station’s shade.

# Server

Servers are designated as space where L5’s restrictions on computer networking are somewhat relaxed. **Clerics** come to the server to access its enormous troves of data and interact with its culture’s AI.

Servers have a large window called a **screen**. Aside from making the server a pleasant place to spend some time, the screen displays announcements and other information that help facilitate large collaborative projects.

# Garage

An entrypoint that can be any size and also functions as a window, the **vent** was an important innovation in orbital technology. Stations suddenly felt much more connected by the new swarms of drones flying continuously between them, carrying messages and new media.

In response to the revolutionary growth in the use of drones, **Programmers** developed as a career distinct from Astronauts. From garages, programmers direct huge flocks of drones and safely shepherd shuttles into the station.

# Studio

Studios are set up in new empty sections of arcade that are still being built. The **vista** is the window that separates the new construction from the edge of space and acts as a transparent scaffolding, pushing outwards as more of the section is completed.

Studio projects are undertaken by **Producers**, who are highly mobile in the vast emptiness of the studio. They also take advantage of the space to set up enormous 3D printers that fabricate parts for the new section, as well as projects unrelated to the ongoing construction.
