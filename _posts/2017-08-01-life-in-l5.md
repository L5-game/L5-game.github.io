*The responsibility of supporting human life in space is shared between five highly specialized Careers.* 

Citizens of the Orbit who dedicate their lives to humanity’s preservation spend years at L1 training at the Five Academies. Their formal education ends when they sign the Constitution and choose a single **Career** and **Culture** to place in the center of their life. 
 
The five Careers, together, support life in space by each taking responsibility for one of the five necessities: **Water**, **Atmosphere**, **Habitat**, **Gravity**, and **Time**.

**ASTRONAUTS** schedule the rotations of the arcades and the flow of shuttles between them to keep the whole station spinning together as a giant clock.
 
*Role: The Astronaut leads the team and keeps them on task and on schedule with their trusty Compass and Drive.*
 
**DIVAS** keep their communities hydrated and relaxed by brewing teas and drawing baths with the finest imported ices harvested from distant asteroids.
 
*Role: Mostly self-sufficient, the Diva always has a trick up their sleeve to help the team get unstuck.*
 
**PRODUCERS** design and print the station’s massive habitation structures - the serpentine Arcades, the central Keep, and the protective Shade enclosing the station.
 
*Role: The Producer is very mobile and can travel easily from arcade to arcade with a Backpack full of useful, customized data.*
 
**CLERICS** keep the station anchored to its spot in relation to other distant stations by constantly updating their exact location and publishing it to their cultural Feed.
 
*Role: Slow and always absorbed in their Feed, the Cleric makes up for their antisocial attitude with the ability to create and store an enormous volume of data.*
 
**PROGRAMMERS** control the weather - they program drafts, currents, and storms of the origami data drones that circulate the station’s vents and keep the air in motion.

*Role: The Programmer keep the team connected by controlling the flow of information.*
