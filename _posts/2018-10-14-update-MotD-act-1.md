A lot has changed in the game and in our lives since the last update in July. 

Bill began a PhD in computational linguistics in Gothenburg, Sweden, and Noah started up another season of designing and writing for theater in New York. But all the while, we’ve been steadily clarifying, simplifying, and hopefully improving L5 from opposite coasts of the Atlantic. 

So take this update as a fresh start: Act One is an exploration of what’s become of the oceans of Earth after they rise miles above what we know them to be now (due, yes, to catastrophic climate change, and also caused by fresh water imported from outer space that has overloaded the water cycle and caused roaming superstorms that never blow out.)

In L5: Mysteries of the Deep, citizens of the orbit begin a search for the truth about what lies beneath the watery surface of their long-abandoned planet. Is there still life under the sea? Are there people down there asking to be saved in a language we don’t speak? The quest begins with a study of the floating “utopian” island-city of Tortuga, which has declined the invitation of the Orbit. Is there truth to the rumors of people clinging to a rotting underbelly, hidden from view by the waves? 

Operating within a brief window when the station’s Blue Telescope is in alignment with Earth, a team of three adventurers must convince the station to refocus its telescope and locate Tortuga. 

We’re hoping this version of the game is (as always) more approachable and more fun, and serves as an introduction to some of the mechanics and lore we’ve been building over the past few years. We’ve also included more illustrations and an introductory dialogue among the characters (like a cut-scene) to welcome players and curious onlookers alike with an easier way to explore the ideas of the game while we refine the more technical and balance-dependent elements of the actual gameplay.

This is a cooperative game for 1-3 players, and you really can play alone, controlling all three characters and using them to solve the puzzle within the time limit. We’ve set the scene and provided the tech, things, systems, and constructs we think you may need to accomplish the task, but the story of how your team accomplishes this goal (or doesn’t) is up to you.

You can find (almost) everything you need to **play the newest version** of L5 right [here](/play).
