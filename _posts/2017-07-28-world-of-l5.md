L5 is set in the future, when we live in space.
 
**The Earth** is uninhabitable - the High Seas have covered all but the tallest mountain peaks, and enormous storm systems torment the atmosphere. **The Moon** has been mined to swiss cheese and it’s thin atmosphere offers little protection from the constant barrage of meteorites, which often cause massive cave-ins deep inside the brittle satellite. 

But humanity persists.
 
Though some have found a way to survive the harsh conditions of life on Earth or on it’s barren satellite, most people live in giant swirling space stations parked in **the LaGrange Points** - five islands of stable orbit created by the wake of the Moon’s gravity.

**L5** is the most populous L-Point and the heart of Orbital Society, where a rainbow of different cultures coexist in chaotic harmony.
 
**L4** is the seat of multifaceted, opulent Tārā culture and the launch point for luxurious mining cruisers headed out to the Asteroid Belt.
 
**L3** is the most remote L-Point and, as maintained by Gaia aid workers, remains the last point of contact with the humans who choose to stay on Earth.
 
**L2**, beyond the Moon, is the site of BlueCorp’s information monasteries — their powerful interstellar arrays endlessly scanning the universe for signs of other intelligent life.
 
**L1** contains the ruins of a space elevator, which, in ancient times, was the main artery between Earth and the Orbit. The ruins now house the Constitution, the living document that unites the five Cultures together as an Orbital Society.
