**L5 is set in the future, when we live in space.**
 
**The Earth** is nearly uninhabitable - the High Seas have covered all but the tallest mountain peaks, and enormous roaming storm systems torment the atmosphere. **The Moon** has been mined to swiss cheese and it’s thin atmosphere offers little protection from the constant barrage of meteorites, causing frequent, massive cave-ins deep inside the brittle satellite.
 
But humanity persists.
 
Though some still find a way to survive the harsh conditions of life on Earth, most people now live in giant swirling space stations parked in the **LaGrange Points** - islands of stable orbit created by the wake of the Moon’s gravity.

**L5** is the most populated L-Point, and the center of Orbital Society, where a rainbow of different cultures coexist in chaotic harmony.
 
**L4** is the seat of the pleasure-seeking Tārā culture and the launch point for luxurious mining cruisers headed out to the Asteroid Belt.
 
**L3** is the most remote L-Point and, as maintained by Gaia aid workers, remains the last point of contact with the humans who choose to stay on Earth.
 
**L2**, beyond the Moon, is the site of BlueCorp’s information monasteries — their powerful interstellar arrays endlessly scanning the expanse of the universe for signs of other intelligent life.
 
**L1** contains the ruins of the Space Elevator, which, in ancient times, was the main artery between Earth and the Orbit. It now houses the Constitution, the shifting, living document that unites the Orbital Society.
