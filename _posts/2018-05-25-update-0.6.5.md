We started figuring out this new version pretty much as soon as we hit publish on 0.6.5. 
There's nothing like putting something out in the world to make you realize all the little ways it could be better.

We also knew we wanted to add a new character. We've really enjoyed playing the Cleric so far. 
They have a super data-heavy playstyle and a different way of getting around the station.

With the Cleric, we also added a new culture, Gaia, and a new arcade with that culture.
The Gaia arcade has an Observatory and a Server. We've been calling it _The Library_.

You can find everything you need to **play the newest version** of L5 right [here](/play). 

### Here's what changed: 

* added a RedCorp Cleric ID, tech, and acessory
* addad a Gaia arcade
* added 10 Gaia Orbit Cards
* added 10 Gaia data
* changed the powers on the Orbit Cards
* reduced the number of Earth Cards to four
* Earth Cards now need 3 data to be fully illuminated 
* simplifed the turn structure to 3 actions
* changed how Earth Cards are played

### What's next?

In the next update, you can expect major changes to the way cards are played.
There's a lot we like about how cards work, but we want to make them feel a little more desireable and fun to play. 

We also have two new characters and one more culture to introduce before we're done, so you can expect some brand new characters to play with.
