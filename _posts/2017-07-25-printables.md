# Make your own L5

Here's what you need:

* 1-5 Character IDs and matching plastic Character Tokens
* 2-10 Tech placemats (2x character)
* 5-25 New Media cards (1x of each color/number combination)
* 3-16 Reference cards (5x Global Powers, 5x Technologies, 3x Ecosystems, 1x Internet)
* 3-5 Arcades and 1 Keep
* 10-50 Data (dice) (10x of each color)


## Dice

A search for "50 dice in 5 colors" will yield multiple results. We have [these](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B076HQMDDV/ref=asc_df_B076HQMDDV5451365) for the moment. The colors aren't perfect, but they're pretty good. If you want, you can use gold foil star stickers to place on top of the sixes.

## Printables

* [Character IDs][1]
* [Faces][2]
* [Card][3]
* [Tech][4]

To make the ID, cut out the color face and tape it to the ID. The face should pop out of the frame a little.

## Tokens

To make tokens, we used [Shrinky Dinks](https://www.amazon.com/Shrinky-Dinks-Creative-Sheets-Frosted/dp/B00Z0P39SK).

1. Trace the lines from the black and white face onto the Shrinky Dink paper (if you're using frosted, draw on the smooth side).
2. Cut out the image. A somewhat loose cut around the outline works well.
3. Follow the Shrinky Dinks instructions. And don't burn down the house!

Optionally, you can cut out the smaller black and white face and attach it to the back, or color it and then attach it to the back. I like simple black lines on a clear token the best.

You can also just cut out the smaller black and white face to use as a token.
