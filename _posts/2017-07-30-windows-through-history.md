Living in space without windows is pretty intolerable. Windows keep everyone oriented. They provide a sense of scale. The bigger the vista the better. 

The biggest windows (usually just called "a window") are communial spaces. Much like a village green or a prehistoric fire circle, they are the focal point around which orbital society is organized.

Stations in L5 have five different kinds of these windows. Each varriety has its own function and customs, and each appeared at a different time in the history of the orbit.

The observatory was the first window to be recognized as a distinct and necessary feature of a space station. Even in the early days of orbital development when RedCorp was building its first commerical habitats, the importance of windows to sustainable space habitation was well known. All permanently enhabitated stations were required by the astronauts to have at least one observatory.

Naturally, the observatory became the place that astronauts would meet to coordinate their work, plan projects, and make decisions. As the seat of municipal power and cultural administration, they continue to have a similar function today.
