Hello all, it's been a while! I've been getting settled in Gothenburg and starting my PhD and Noah's been writing plays and starting a theater company. But we haven't forgotten about L5 (of course)! We've been working on a new version that we're excited to share with you at some point in the not-too-distant future.  

When Noah was in Sweden in February we were pretty close to finishing a new version that was mainly an improvement on the last release, but it still wasn't feeling as fun as we wanted, so we took a step back and stripped the game down to the things we were enjoying the most. What we have to offer is a game centered around tech that plays a bit like a trading card-style duel with lots of dice rolling excitement. It's quite fun! Even in the very un-polished state it's in. And we're excited about the idea of telling stories and building the world of L5 through booster pack-style mini-releases.

So does this mean L5 isn't a *co-operative role playing board game set in the future when we live in space* anymore? Well, it's still set in the future when we live in space. And we're not giving up on the idea of role playing or co-op, but this duel style gameplay is really fun at the moment, and it feels like something that could be a good foundation for more storytelling-oriented mechanics in the future. As for the board... we'll see. The station always felt like the least interesting part of our previous iterations, but maybe we can find a good way to make that appealing again too. But like I said, for now we're having a lot of fun with this card game, so stay tuned!
