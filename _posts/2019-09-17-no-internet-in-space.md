As Bill said in the last post, lots is changing in the game -- is it a board game? is it cooperative? We’ll share more about this latest draft (which is, yes, currently card-based and, yes, competitive) but first I’m here to talk a little bit about what’s stayed the same. L5 is still set in the future, when we live in space:

In the ancient past, the people of The Orbit abandoned a poisoned earth overrun with polarized factions, environmental catastrophe, and a corrupted Internet. They fled to swirling space stations anchored near the LaGrange Points, zones of stable orbit in the wake of the Moon’s gravity. But preserving life in the void requires deeper trust, clearer communication, and persistent peace. 

So the early citizens of the Orbital Society severed connection with Earth, banned networked communications, and quarantined computational power to prevent new internets from emerging in space. Instead, the people of The Orbit rely on **constructs** —- isolated digital daemons that collect and analyze data —- and coordinated **systems** of machines that circulate that information. This approach to technological connectivity puts thoughtful, autonomous humans at the nodes of every network. 

The idea of an Internet replaced by its component parts has been central to the game and its setting since our earliest imaginings. These **orbital technologies** are a useful lens to think about our IRL relationships to technology and global culture, and each iteration of the mechanics is an attempt to better articulate how they might work. Through the science fiction of L5 we’re trying to understand the Internet by imagining a future without it.
