# About L5

L5 is a cooperative role-playing strategy game set in the future, when we live in space.

And L5 is currently in development but we're making playable, imperfect beta builds available for curious and adventurous folks to print and playtest (you just need to supply your own D6s).

If you play L5, please let us know about your experience! Email us at L5BoardGame@gmail.com or on Twitter [@l5game](https://twitter.com/L5_game). We'd love to hear from you.

# About the site

This site is where we’ll post updates about the [world we’re building](/tag/world-of-l5}), track highlights from our [development process](/tag/meta), and publish and update a printable, [DIY version of the game](/play) as we make it so you can play along at home and tell us what’s cool and what’s broken.

We built this site using the [Jasper](https://github.com/jekyller/jasper) theme for [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static website generator.
