# What's *L5*?

***L5* is a cooperative role-playing strategy game** where you and your friends become a team of experts trying to prevent giant space stations from breaking apart. With unique skill sets, specialized *tech*, and a stacked deck of *talents*, you’ll overcome personal *crises*, unlock hidden *files*, and confront the station’s super-powered leadership to keep everything hanging together in a stable orbit. While playing through each station, you’ll ask questions and gather clues about the wider world of L5... hints which may lead you past the edges of Orbital Society to the lonely places where Legends live.
