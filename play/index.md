# Make your own L5

![backpack]({{ site.url}}/assets/images/backpack-print.jpg)

Here's what you'll need:

5. 3 **Arcades** and 1 **Keep** (attached to the blue arcade)
1. 2 Character **IDs** and matching plastic Character **Tokens**
2. 4 **Tech** cards (2x character)
3. 15 **Story cards** (1x of each color/number combination) and   
   8 **Reference cards** (3x Global Powers, 2x Technologies, 2x Ecosystems, 1x Internet)
6. 30 Six-sided dice (aka: **data**) (10x of each color - red, blue, violet)

You can find almost everything you need to play here (you just need to provide your own dice):
* [Printables]({{ site.url}}/assets/downloads/L5-PRINTABLES_0.6.3.pdf)
* [Rules]({{ site.url}}/assets/downloads/L5-RULES_0.6.3.pdf)

## Station Pieces (Arcades and Keep)

![game pieces]({{ site.url}}/assets/images/pieces4.jpg)

L5 is played on a modular space station board that can be arranged in any configuration. 

Cut out the arcades and keep from the first page of the PDF. We recommend printing this PDF on cardstock if possible (we used 110lb).

Each room on the station has its room type indicated by an adjacent symbol on the page. You can refer back to this page if in doubt, but you should be able to cut away the symbols as the room types are also indicated by the design of the room (look especially for the red, blue, or violet markings).

## IDs & Tech

![game pieces]({{ site.url}}/assets/images/pieces3.jpg)

The characters and their specific move sets and powers are represented by their ID cards and Tech.

Cut out the _character IDs_ and _tech_ from the second page of _printables_. 

Then, cut out the full-color faces at the bottom of the page (you can leave a loose white boarder around the faces). 
Tape the faces to the blank part of the IDs, or draw your own. 

## Tokens

Small plastic tokens track the characters' movement through the station. 

We use [Shrinky Dinks](https://www.amazon.com/Shrinky-Dinks-Creative-Sheets-Frosted/dp/B00Z0P39SK) to create clear plastic tokens with the characters' faces drawn on them. To make these tokens - 

1. Trace the lines from the line art faces (on the second page of _printables_) with a permanent marker
onto the Shrinky Dink plastic sheet (if one side is frosted, draw on the smooth side).
2. Cut out the image. Again, a somewhat loose cut around the outline works well.
3. Follow the Shrinky Dinks instructions to bake and shrink the plastic. And don't burn down the house!

Alternatively, can just cut out the small color faces on the _station_ page to use as tokens. Back them with cardboard or foamboard for easier play,
or use coins or buttons or whatever you've got! 

## Cards

![game pieces]({{ site.url}}/assets/images/pieces2.jpg)
![game pieces]({{ site.url}}/assets/images/pieces1.jpg)

There are two kinds of cards in L5 - Story Cards (minor arcana) and References (major arcana).

Cut out the cards from the third and fourth pages of _printables_ - and don't forget to round the corners.

There's also a handy meta-reference card with a guide to room symbols and culture-colors.
(NB: It falsely refers to "story cards" as "new media cards" - a holdover from an earlier version.)

## Data (Dice)

![game pieces]({{ site.url}}/assets/images/pieces5.jpg)

A search for "50 dice in 5 colors" will yield multiple results. We have [these](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B076HQMDDV/ref=asc_df_B076HQMDDV5451365) for the moment. The colors aren't perfect, but they're pretty good. If you want, you can use gold foil star stickers to place on top of the sixes.
