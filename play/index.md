# Make your own L5

![backpack]({{ site.url}}/assets/images/backpack-print.jpg)

Here's what you'll need:

5. 4 **Arcades** and 1 **Keep** (attached to the blue arcade)
1. 3 Character **IDs** and matching plastic Character **Tokens**
2. 6 **Tech** cards (2x per character)
3. 15 **Orbit Cards** (1x of each color/number combination) and   
   4 **Earth Cards** (3 Water Cards + _The Internet_)
6. 40 Six-sided dice (aka: **data**) (10x of each color - red, green, blue, violet)

You can find almost everything you need to play here (you just need to provide your own dice):
* [Printables]({{ site.url}}/assets/downloads/L5-PRINTABLES_0.6.5.pdf)
* [Rules]({{ site.url}}/assets/downloads/L5-RULES_0.6.5.pdf)

## The Station Game Board -  Arcades & The Keep

![game pieces]({{ site.url}}/assets/images/pieces1.jpg)

L5 is played on a modular space station board that can be arranged in any configuration. 

Cut out the _arcades_ and the _keep_ from the first page of the PDF. We recommend printing all the PDFs on cardstock if possible (we used 110lb cardstock) and mounting the arcades on cardboard for extra stability.

## Character Gear - IDs, Tech & Accessories

![game pieces]({{ site.url}}/assets/images/pieces2.jpg)

Each character in L5 has a unique Tech, Accessory, Face, and ID that contain their power-set and store their data.

Cut out the _character IDs_ and _tech_ and _accessories_ from the second and third pages of _printables_. 

Then, cut out the full-color faces and tape them to the blank part of the IDs, or draw your own. 

There's also a handy meta-reference card with a guide to the basic elements of the world of the game.

## Tokens

Small plastic tokens track the characters' movement through the station. 

We use [Shrinky Dinks](https://www.amazon.com/Shrinky-Dinks-Creative-Sheets-Frosted/dp/B00Z0P39SK) to create clear plastic tokens with the characters' faces drawn on them. To make these tokensâ€”

1. Trace the lines from the line art faces (on the second page of _printables_) with a permanent marker
onto the Shrinky Dink plastic sheet (if one side is frosted, draw on the smooth side).
2. Cut out the image. Again, a somewhat loose cut around the outline works well.
3. Follow the Shrinky Dinks instructions to bake and shrink the plastic. And don't burn down the house!

Alternatively, can just cut out the small color faces on the _station_ page to use as tokens by backing them with cardboard or foamboard for easier play. Or use coins, buttons, beads, whatever you've got! 

## Cards & Data

![game pieces]({{ site.url}}/assets/images/pieces3.jpg)

There 4 Earth Cards in 0.6.5 - Three Water Cards _(Manhatlantis, The High Seas, and Warheads)_ and _The Internet._ For now they serve as the goal markers of the L5 Board Game.

There are also 20 Orbit Cards (five suits and four colors) which are dealt out in stacks like solitaire, burying the Earth Cards. When *cleared,* they become useful power-ups in the hands of the right character. 

Print the cards from the fourth and fifth pages of _printables_ - on cardstock and cut out the cards - don't forget to round the corners.

And, finally... the only thing we haven't figured out how to print yet - 

Playing L5 requires *40 6-Sided Dice,* which are called *data* in the world of the game. These dice should include 10 of each of these colors - Red, Green, Blue, Violet - though the full version of L5 will also include 10 clear (or yellow) dice.  

A search for "50 dice in 5 colors" will yield multiple results. We have [these](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B076HQMDDV/ref=asc_df_B076HQMDDV5451365) for the moment. The colors aren't perfect, but they're pretty good. If you want, you can use gold foil star stickers to place on top of the sixes.
