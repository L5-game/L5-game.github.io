# Make your own L5

![backpack]({{ site.url}}/assets/images/backpack-print.jpg)

Here's what you'll need:

- 3 Character IDs-tokens-faces & tech
  - Blue Cleric / crown
  - Blue Astronaut / compass
  - Gaia Programmer / gloves
- 1 Station with 4 Arcades
  - Blue Telescope (keep, lvls 1-3)
  - Blue Studio (lvl1)
  - Blue Server (lvl1)
  - Blue Garage (lvl2)
- 16 orbit cards:
  - 7 things
  - 5 systems
  - 3 constructs
  - 1 alignment
- 50 data (standard D6s):
  - 10 - blue
  - 10 - green
  - 10 - red
  - 10 - violet
  - 10 - light yellow/gold/clear/wild
- 16 Covers (coins, counters, etc.)


## The Station (game board)

L5 is played on a modular space station board that can be arranged in any configuration. 
Cut out the _arcades_ and the _keep_ from the first page of the PDF. Only cut along the black lines (the keep should remain connected to the amphitheater, garage, and three observatories that constitute the _blue telescope_. 

We recommend printing all the PDFs on cardstock if possible (we used 110lb cardstock) and mounting the arcades on cardboard for extra stability.

## Character Gear - IDs, Tech & Accessories

Each character in L5 has a unique Tech, Accessory, Face, and ID that contain their power-set and store their data.

Cut out the _character IDs_ and _tech_,
then, cut out the full-color faces and tape them to the blank part of the IDs, or draw your own. 

## Orbit Cards 

Print and cut out the 16 _orbit cards_.

## Tokens

Small plastic tokens track the characters' movement through the station. 

We use [Shrinky Dinks](https://www.amazon.com/Shrinky-Dinks-Creative-Sheets-Frosted/dp/B00Z0P39SK) to create clear plastic tokens with the characters' faces drawn on them. To make these tokensâ€”

1. Trace the lines from the line art faces (on the _faces_ pdf) with a permanent marker
onto the Shrinky Dink plastic sheet (if one side is frosted, draw on the smooth side).
2. Cut out the image. A somewhat loose cut around the outline works best.
3. Follow the Shrinky Dinks instructions to bake and shrink the plastic. And don't burn down the house!

Alternatively, can just cut out the small color faces on the _station_ page to use as tokens by backing them with cardboard or foamboard for easier play. Or use coins, buttons, beads, whatever you've got! 

## Covers

Any kind of small coins or counters will work.

## Data (dice)

And, finally... the only thing we haven't figured out how to print yet - 

Playing L5 requires *50 6-Sided Dice,* which are called *data* in the world of the game. These dice should include 10 of each of these colors - Red, Green, Blue, Violet - though the full version of L5 will also include 10 clear (or yellow) dice.  

A search for "50 dice in 5 colors" will yield multiple results. We have [these](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B076HQMDDV/ref=asc_df_B076HQMDDV5451365) for the moment. The colors aren't perfect, but they're pretty good. If you want, you can use gold foil star stickers to place on top of the sixes.

You can _probably_ get away with fewer than 50 dice in Act 1. But the limit of 10 data per culture is built in to the rules (you can't use more than that even of you have them).
